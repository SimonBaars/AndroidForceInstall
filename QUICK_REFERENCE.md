# Quick Reference: Signature Mismatch

## ‚ùì What's Happening?

You're seeing an error like:
- `signatures do not match`
- `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`

This means the new APK is signed with a **different cryptographic key** than the installed app.

## ‚úÖ BEST Solution: Re-sign the APK

**If you have the original signing key:**

```bash
# Step 1: Remove old signature
zip -d your-app.apk META-INF/\*

# Step 2: Sign with original key
apksigner sign --ks your-keystore.jks your-app.apk

# Step 3: Install normally
adb install your-app.apk
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ No data loss, no permission resets, no issues!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback: Use This App (Uninstall/Reinstall)

**If you DON'T have the original key:**

1. Use AndroidForceInstall to install the APK
2. The app will automatically:
   - ‚úÖ Backup your data
   - ‚úÖ Uninstall old app
   - ‚úÖ Install new app
   - ‚úÖ Restore your data

**Result**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Most data preserved, but:
- ‚ùå Permissions WILL be reset (must re-grant)
- ‚ùå Encrypted data MAY be lost
- ‚ùå Keystore data WILL be lost

## üö´ What's NOT Possible

- ‚ùå Force new APK to use old signature
- ‚ùå Avoid uninstall if signatures don't match
- ‚ùå Preserve permissions across signature change
- ‚ùå Decrypt data encrypted with old signature

## üí° Key Takeaway

**Signatures are cryptographic and cannot be forged.**
- Best option: Re-sign with original key
- Only alternative: Uninstall and reinstall
- Some data loss is inevitable without the original key
