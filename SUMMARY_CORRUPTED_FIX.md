# Summary: Corrupted Installation Fix

## What Was Fixed

The app now properly handles **corrupted app installations** that previously caused the error:
> "Could not find installed APK location"

## The Problem You Reported

You had an app that:
- Was corrupted (not installed according to Android)
- But couldn't be installed through normal means
- Had leftover files/data in the system

When you tried to install it using AndroidForceInstall, you got the error "Could not find installed APK location".

## Why It Happened

The app's logic only looked for **signature mismatch errors** specifically. When a corrupted installation caused **other types of errors**, the code didn't know how to handle them and would try to find the APK location (which failed because the app wasn't properly installed).

## The Fix

Now, when ANY installation fails, the app:

1. **Extracts the package name** from the APK you're trying to install
2. **Checks if the app is actually installed** according to Android's PackageManager
3. **If NOT installed** (corrupted or fresh install):
   - Runs `pm uninstall` to clean up any leftover files
   - Runs `pm install` to install fresh
   - ✅ Success!

## How to Use It

Just use the app normally:

1. Open AndroidForceInstall
2. Select your APK
3. Tap "Force Install"
4. The app will automatically detect corruption and clean it up

You should see the status message:
> "App not installed or corrupted. Cleaning up and installing..."

Then:
> "App installed successfully"

## What You'll Notice

**Before the fix:**
- ❌ Error: "Could not find installed APK location"
- ❌ Installation failed
- ❌ You had to manually clean up with adb

**After the fix:**
- ✅ Status: "App not installed or corrupted. Cleaning up and installing..."
- ✅ Installation succeeds automatically
- ✅ No manual cleanup needed

## What's Next

This fix is ready to use! The code changes have been committed and are minimal:
- Only ~20 lines of code changed
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All previous scenarios (fresh install, signature mismatch) still work

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues with the fix:
1. Check logcat output: `adb logcat | grep AndroidForceInstall`
2. Make sure you have root access
3. Verify the APK file is valid
4. Try the test cases in `TEST_PLAN_CORRUPTED_INSTALLATION.md`
