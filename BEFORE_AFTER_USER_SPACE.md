# Before/After: User Space Fix Comparison

## The Problem

**Before**: Commands operated on different user contexts
```
pm install -d -r <apk>           → Installs to private space (default)
pm path <package>                → Queries user space
pm uninstall <package>           → Operates on user space
am force-stop <package>          → Stops in user space
```

**Result**: App installed in private space but queries/operations looked in user space → App not found!

## The Solution

**After**: All commands consistently operate on user space (user 0)
```
pm install -d -r --user 0 <apk>      → Installs to user 0 (user space)
pm path --user 0 <package>           → Queries user 0 (user space)  
pm uninstall --user 0 <package>      → Operates on user 0 (user space)
am force-stop --user 0 <package>     → Stops in user 0 (user space)
```

**Result**: All operations consistently target user 0 → App found and operations succeed!

## Code Changes

### Location 1: Initial Installation (Line 183)
```diff
- Shell.Result result = Shell.cmd("pm install -d -r \"" + apkPath + "\"").exec();
+ Shell.Result result = Shell.cmd("pm install -d -r --user 0 \"" + apkPath + "\"").exec();
```

### Location 2: Corrupted App Cleanup (Lines 250-251)
```diff
  Shell.Result forceInstallResult = Shell.cmd(
-     "pm uninstall " + packageName,
-     "pm install -d -r \"" + apkPath + "\""
+     "pm uninstall --user 0 " + packageName,
+     "pm install -d -r --user 0 \"" + apkPath + "\""
  ).exec();
```

### Location 3: APK Path Query (Line 294)
```diff
- Shell.Result pathResult = Shell.cmd("pm path " + packageName).exec();
+ Shell.Result pathResult = Shell.cmd("pm path --user 0 " + packageName).exec();
```

### Location 4: Force Stop (Line 343)
```diff
- Shell.Result stopResult = Shell.cmd("am force-stop " + packageName).exec();
+ Shell.Result stopResult = Shell.cmd("am force-stop --user 0 " + packageName).exec();
```

### Location 5: APK Registration (Line 395)
```diff
- Shell.Result registerResult = Shell.cmd("pm install -d -r \"" + baseApkPath + "\"").exec();
+ Shell.Result registerResult = Shell.cmd("pm install -d -r --user 0 \"" + baseApkPath + "\"").exec();
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Apps installed to private space
- ❌ Queries looked in user space
- ❌ APK replacement failed (couldn't find installed APK)
- ❌ Inconsistent behavior across multi-user devices

### After Fix
- ✅ Apps install to user space
- ✅ Queries look in user space
- ✅ APK replacement works (can find installed APK)
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all devices
- ✅ Proper multi-user support
